# Multiple Youtube uploads via API
Many of my friends and other people around the forums have been complaining about slow upload times on youtube and how it is inconvinient to put a title, description and thumbnail on every video seperetly. The goal if this project is to reduce time and allow the user to edit and upload videos in bulk via youtube api integration in a python program.

*DONE*
- Upload a video
- Give it a title
- tags
- description
- take ALL vidoes which are dropped in a specific folder

*COMING SOON*
- User interface in the works
- Error and bug fixes
- Scheduled uploads
- Intervals between uploads
- Get best trending tags, based on the video category and title
- Upload thumbnails
- Delete videos on a channel in bulk

This project is mainly created to see the API integration capabilities on youtube platform via python programming language. If there is a demand for this kind of program a public release might be in the works but would first need to get approval from youtube.
